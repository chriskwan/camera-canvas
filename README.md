# About Camera Canvas

**Camera Canvas** is image editing software developed for people with severe motor impairments who cannot use their hands to operate a mouse or keyboard. It is designed for use with the [Camera Mouse](http://cameramouse.bu.edu/), software that allows you to control the mouse pointer by moving your head in front of a web camera. Using **Camera Canvas** and [Camera Mouse](http://cameramouse.bu.edu/), you can edit images and draw pictures just by moving your head!

Both programs are completely free. We are constantly working on making them better by incorporating feedback from our users. Please try our latest versions and let us know what you think!
